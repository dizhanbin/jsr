Hello everyone,I'm 17f. Today I will introduce you a flutter development plugin.
Developers can easily use the reflection for json and sqlite operations.

We open Android studio in the plugin management search for jsr installation restart.


We create two new class files MClass.dart MStudent.dart

the dart bean inheritance from jsrR


After the file is built, we right click on the pop-up menu and select ifelse add to class

Ok, we can see that several class files are generated in the lib/jsr folder.

Next, let's do some testing.

Add sqflite library to the pubspec.yaml to add support for sqlite

We create a new test file test_reflect.dart

Import Class.dart

json parse

bean to json string
